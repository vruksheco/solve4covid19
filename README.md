# solve4covid19


COVID-19 is still spreading exponentially throughout the world. Current statistics indicate that 15-20% of people who get it require hospitalization for respiratory failure for multiple weeks. The hardship falls on elderly people, medical personnel as well as the healthcare system in general.
Identifying the main pain points in the current health crisis situation, Vruksh Ecosystem calls the community of data scientists, healthcare professionals, students, entrepreneurs, researchers, designers, and tech professionals to come up with solutions for:
– Protecting the elderly and medical workers
– Offloading the healthcare system with faster diagnosis options and medical equipment delivery and/or assembly
– Assisting with daily responsibilities for the ones who need it the most (e.g childcare, grocery shopping and medication etc.)
This Sunday, March 22nd, we are kicking off an online hackathon #Solve4Covid19 to find creative solutions for given problems within a short period of time. We’re encouraging data scientists, entrepreneurs, social workers, designers, engineers (and everyone!) to join us.
 

Purpose

The purpose of the event is to call for more actions to create, including but not limited to, product prototypes, code, user experience design, and business/social influence models, to help fight the COVID-19 epidemic.

It encourages social innovation, the use of open-source cooperation to help fight the epidemic, and the creation of shared value among volunteers, organisations, enterprises and platforms.
